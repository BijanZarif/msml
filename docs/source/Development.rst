Documentation
-------------

The documentation is generated by Sphinx_. Please refer to `sphinx' documenation <http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html>`_

Some parts of the documenation is generated. The Python API documenation is done with ``autodoc`` from sphinx.
`create_docs.py`` generates the documenation of Elements and Operators and rips the ``MSMLDOC`` comments out of the C++ files.

We provide for configuration for `astyle <http://astyle.sourceforge.net/>_` configuration.
Please use this for code formation before commits.


Style Guide
-----------


General
^^^^^^^


1. You should put the preamble in front of every source file.

   .. literalinclude:: ../../share/preamble.txt

2. Every source file should have the information about authors and creation date.

   :Python: ``__author__`` and ``__date__`` in each file.
   :C++: Authorship should given in a comment.


3. Use code formatting.

   :C++: you can use ``astyle`` with the given config.
   :Python: the default formatting from Python is good enough.


4. Use `pylint` for measuring the code quality.

5. Test new commits....

.. todo::
    More rules. Rules for committing after final release.
