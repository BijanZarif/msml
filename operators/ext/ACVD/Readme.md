### Info ###
This code is the implementation deriving from those papers:

Valette, "Approach-guided controlled resolution brain meshing for FE-based interactive neurosurgery simulation", Workshop on Mesh Processing in Medical Image Analysis, in conjunction with MICCAI 2011., Toronto, Canada, pp. 176--186, 09/2011.


This code is cross-platform and should compile under Linux ,MacOS and Window$ OS.
### Licence ###
This code is distributed under the CeCILL-B license (BSD-compatible)
(copyright CNRS, INSA-Lyon, UCBL, INSERM.)


###  Dependencies ###
* VTK www.vtk.org (version 5.x, version 6.x in the vtk6 branch : https://github.com/valette/ACVD/tree/vtk6) 
* CMAKE www.cmake.org

###  Simple compilation HowTo under Linux ###
	git clone https://github.com/valette/ACVD.git
	cd ACVD
	cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	make

the executables (ACVD, ACVDQ and AnisotropicRemeshingQ should be found under the "bin" subdirectory)

### Note for window$ users ###
if you get this compilation error :
	fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file '..\bin\Debug\vtkSurface.lib'
you can fix it by unselecting 'build_shared_libs' with the cmake UI

### Options ###
execute ACVD and ACVDQ without arguments to see the available options.

the output of the program is written in the file simplification.ply

additionnally, when running ACVD, a file output_1.ply is also written. It is the output mesh before post-processing using quadrics.

note that to enforce a manifold output mesh, such as explained in [3], you need to use the -m 1 option, and to define a correct number of spare clusters using options -sf or -sc.
